Player Card
-----

In the /player path, you'll find sample code to set up a basic Player Card for your site. 

The basic steps to deploy are are:

- Unzip the contents into a publicly accessible path on your website
- Open the page.html file and ensure the twitter:image, twitter:player and twitter:player:stream values point to your server and file locations
- Update the content that you're pointing to (don't use the sample video, please!)
- Ensure all paths are specified as secure (https://)
- Test your URL 

To test your experience, please visit the following URL:

https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player

At that site, you will also find information on general rules, in case you choose to extend the experience to fit your own platform and media player.
